# ProfileManifests
Manifest repository for the ProfilePayloads framework and [ProfileCreator](https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator).

## Manifest Format
The payload manifest files are using Apple's Preference Manifest File format to describe the payloads and their keys.

To meet all required functionality that format has been extended with more keys and options. Use this reference to create manifests for the ProfilePayloads framework and ProfileCreator.
